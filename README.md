# Decentralized-AgentMesh-with-A2A
Decentralized Agent Mesh is a peer-to-peer architecture where autonomous AI agents collaborate without a central controller using secure A2A messaging. Each agent runs as a split process (A2A Server + ADK Executor) with DB-backed handshakes, circuit breakers, and semantic failover for fault-tolerant, scalable coordination.
